# Resources

## LaTeX

I am sorry to say that LaTeX is the standard for mathematical type setting and document creation---it is, it has been, and it will continue to be. I advise all students to learn LaTeX now before later. There is often no avoiding it.

### LaTeX Distributions
- [Overleaf (Online LaTeX IDE)](https://www.overleaf.com/)
- [TexLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
- [MacTeX (Mac)](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)
- [MiKTeX (Windows)](https://miktex.org/)

### General References
  - [Overleaf knowledge base (LaTeX tutorials and references)](https://www.overleaf.com/learn)
  - [LaTeX @ Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX)
  
### LaTeX Packages
  - [TiKZ (Graphs)](http://www.texample.net/tikz/)
  - [Mathpartir (Inference Rules)](http://cristal.inria.fr/~remy/latex/); also ask me about Mark Jones' infer.sty package if interested.
  
### Additional LaTeX Tools
  - [HackMD (Online Markdown + LaTeX collaborative editor)](https://hackmd.io/)
  - [Latexmk (LaTeX “Make” script)](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html)
  - [Latexrun (command-line wrapper)](https://github.com/aclements/latexrun)
  - [Detexify (symbol reverse-lookup)](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html)
  - [latex2png (to use equations, e.g., in PowerPoint)](http://latex2png.com/)
  - [Pandoc (conversion between many document formats)](https://pandoc.org/)

## Markdown
I like markdown, and so do most people. If I am in need of a markup language, I will almost always find a way to use markdown. (This site is written in markdown using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).)

Some useful links.
- Professor Osera has a great write-up [here](https://osera.cs.grinnell.edu/csc341/readings/markdown.html) on how to use markdown.
- See [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org) for another straightforward introduction.
- Github, which you will use in your career (but not this class), has its own flavor of markdown. See its [formal specification](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and (a more friendly) guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github). 
- I sometimes use [Pandoc](pandoc.org) (also linked above & described by [Osera](https://osera.cs.grinnell.edu/csc341/readings/markdown.html)) to render markdown to html, LaTeX, and pdf. Also, Pandoc is written in Haskell!
- I have heard good things about [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/), which I believe lets you format documents in markdown with native support for LaTeX. I've yet to use it, but I have had students recommend it.

## Other Texts and Readings

### On Theory of Computation
- I first learned about _complexity_ and _computability_ from [Arora and Barak](https://theory.cs.princeton.edu/complexity/). It's a good reference. _Available free online at link provided._

### On Programming Languages (Very, very optional)
- I am bound to talk about programming language theory during this semester. For those of you whom I manage to convince how great it is, I recommend:
  - [Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!](https://www.learnyouahaskell.com/) for a fun introduction to (pure) functional programming in Haskell. This is the entry point for many people (myself included) interested in functional programming languages. _Available free online at link provided._
  - [Programming Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/) for an excellent introduction to dependent type theory, language metatheory, and language mechanization. _Available free online at link provided._
  - I also recommend [Verified Functional Programming in Agda](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.1145/2841316), written by my advisor Aaron Stump. Not available online, but speak to me if you are interested and price is an issue.
  - [Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/) is the de facto standard for all things PL. Every researcher I know has a copy. That being said, Pierce largely ignores _denotational semantics_ in favor of _operational semantics_, which I find boring. For denotational semantics, I recommend [Programming Language Foundations](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Foundations-Aaron-Stump/dp/1118007476), which is also written by my advisor Aaron Stump. (So, feel free to email me if you are interested and price is an issue.)


## On Technical Writing
Technical writing is hard. While you won't have to do a ton of it in this course, it is something I encourage those of you with an interest in graduate school to take seriously. Here are some resources that have helped me a lot.

- [_Imagining the Reader_, Ben Pierce.](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/PLMW2023-ImaginingTheReader.pdf) 
- [_Mathematical Writing_, Donald Knuth.](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf)
- [_The Chicago Manual of Style_.](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) I also highly recommend [Garner's Modern American Usage](https://www.amazon.com/Garners-Modern-American-Usage-Garner/dp/0195382757).
- [_The Elements of Style_, Strunk and White. ](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X) A bit outdated, and written in a time when pedagogical technique largely had to do with the form of your ruler swing. I think it is nevertheless a short and helpful read, even if just for reference of how _some_ people think writing _ought_ to be done.
