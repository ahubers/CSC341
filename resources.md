## On Technical Writing
Technical writing is hard. While you won't have to do a ton of it in this course, it is something I encourage those of you with an interest in graduate school to take seriously. Here are some resources that have helped me a lot.

- [_Imagining the Reader_, Ben Pierce.](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/PLMW2023-ImaginingTheReader.pdf) 
- [_Mathematical Writing_, Donald Knuth.](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf)
- [_The Chicago Manual of Style_.](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) I also highly recommend [Garner's Modern American Usage](https://www.amazon.com/Garners-Modern-American-Usage-Garner/dp/0195382757).
- [_The Elements of Style_, Strunk and White. ](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X) A bit outdated, and written in a time when pedagogical technique largely had to do with the form of your ruler swing. I think it is nevertheless a short and helpful read, even if just for reference of how _some_ people think writing _ought_ to be done.
